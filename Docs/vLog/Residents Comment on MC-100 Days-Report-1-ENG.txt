This reads more like PR than reporting — too many “first time in history” claims, and too little evidence: dates, records, and measurable data.

Charity is appreciated, but the same document admits the park chairs and the Masjid solar system were funded by AWG members from their own pocket — so please don’t market donations as Management Committee “achievements.” Donation is one thing; governance performance is another.

“Friendly behavior” is a good basic standard, not an achievement. Real performance is measurable: complaint registers, timelines, cost breakdown (society funds vs donations), and meeting minutes accessible to members.

The biggest concern is “Commercialisation”: it’s called a core issue, yet turned into a black box — while everything else is discussed publicly. This selective silence sounds like: “Just trust us, don’t ask — do you not trust us?”
If it’s truly core, members deserve a formal written update: case number, next hearing date, and what relief is being sought.

And one practical reality: if commercial-zone plots are genuinely expected to become residential homes, show it in action. Hundreds of houses exist in the residential area, but not even one visible home construction has started in the commercial zone.

This also creates a serious concern: Society-level NOC fee inflows are not visible, and members naturally ask whether any “alternative” collection path exists outside transparent accounting. If not, then clarify it cleanly.
