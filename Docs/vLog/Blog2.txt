**Meta description:** A practical, law-safe guide for residents and management committees: governance hierarchy, AGM mandate, progress reporting, parks/open spaces, and how to keep WhatsApp debates constructive and legal.

## Why this blog exists

In our society discussions (especially on WhatsApp), the real conflict is usually not “people vs committee.” It’s **confusion about mandate**.

Some members treat a **party manifesto** (internal to a group) as if it is the **public mandate**. That confusion triggers friction, because a cooperative housing society’s management is **not a political parliament**—it is an **executive body** that runs operations under the law and the society’s own rules.

This blog is written to keep the conversation **structured, residents-first, and within the rule of law**.

## The legal & governance hierarchy

A clean way to think about governance is a **stack** (top overrides bottom):

1. **Constitution of Pakistan**
2. **Federal laws**
3. **Provincial laws**
4. **Cooperative Societies law + rules** (and Registrar/Cooperative Department framework) ([cooperatives.punjab.gov.pk][1])
5. **Registered Society By-Laws** ([cooperatives.punjab.gov.pk][2])
6. **AGM-approved agenda & resolutions** (members’ majority decisions) ([cooperatives.punjab.gov.pk][1])
7. **Management Committee decisions** (execution within the above)

Key point: Under cooperative law, **powers vest in the general body**, and the managing committee exercises powers **delegated** by that general body and within the framework of rules/by-laws. ([cooperatives.punjab.gov.pk][1])

So if something at a lower level clashes with a higher level, it doesn’t become “brave leadership”—it becomes a **compliance problem**.

## “Manifesto” is not “mandate”

A **party manifesto** can be a nice internal plan. But it cannot override:

* the **by-laws**,
* the **AGM agenda**,
* or the **law**.

If a manifesto conflicts with the oath/duty to follow the legal framework, the correct choice is simple: **conform to the oath and the rule-book**. ([cooperatives.punjab.gov.pk][1])

That’s not politics. That’s governance hygiene.

## What a proper “progress report” should look like

A progress report should map to **AGM-approved items**, not personal preferences.

A residents-friendly progress report typically includes:

* **Overall completion %** of AGM agenda
* **Item-wise completion %**
* **Delays + reasons**
* **Revised timeline**
* **Evidence/attachments** (work order, approvals, photos, invoices where applicable)

If an activity wasn’t in the AGM agenda (example: a “family gathering,” or showcasing donated items as “committee performance”), it may be a positive activity—but it should be reported as **additional activity**, not as **AGM mandate delivery**.

Also: if past community donors delivered major welfare work, ethical reporting means **credit goes to donors**, not rebranded as committee performance.

## Parks, open spaces, and “commercial ideas”

In Lahore, land use is regulated through LDA’s land-use framework, where **“open space & recreational”** is a defined land-use class. ([Lahore Development Authority][3])
So when residents worry about “park commercialization” (café/kiosk/structures), the correct approach is not WhatsApp shouting. It’s:

1. **Identify the land status** (society record, approvals, maps, relevant authority).
2. **Check by-laws + approvals required**.
3. **Ask for written clarification and NOCs** before any irreversible work. ([Lahore Development Authority][3])

This keeps everyone safe: residents, committee, and vendors.

## Feedback systems: diary number should be a record, not a barrier

A diary/receipt number is fine as a **tracking mechanism**. The problem starts when it becomes a **filter** (forcing unnecessary office visits, slowing down issues, or discouraging residents from recording feedback).

A good system is:

* online submission + auto-acknowledgement
* diary number tracking
* public monthly status summary (received / resolved / pending)

That’s how trust compounds.

**Slogan:** *Mental Freedom, not mental slavery.*
Meaning: don’t outsource your thinking to slogans; anchor it to the constitution, law, by-laws, and AGM mandate.
