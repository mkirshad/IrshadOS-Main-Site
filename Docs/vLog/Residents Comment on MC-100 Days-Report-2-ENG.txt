The progress report shared by the current MC didn’t make sense to us — for a simple reason: the MC is not a law-making body or a “direction-setting” committee based on personal preference; it is an executing body.

The annual agenda given by the members was approved in the AGM (Annual General Meeting) by majority vote, and that is the committee’s mandate and inheritance. So when you share progress, it should be aligned only with the AGM-approved agenda:

* What overall percentage of the agenda has been completed?
* What percentage has been implemented for each agenda item individually?
* Which items are delayed, why, and what is the revised timeline?

On the other hand, activities based on personal opinion, party manifesto, or an imagined list — whether it’s a family get-together, or placing donated chairs — if these were not approved in the AGM agenda, then for us they are not “progress.” They may be separate activities, but they are not AGM-mandate reporting.

Our request is simple:
Please share a clear, numbered progress report with percentages against the AGM-approved agenda — so every member can see how much work has actually been done on the real mandate.

One final point: based on current behavior, it appears the MC wants to act as judge, jury, and executor all at once — and that is not acceptable to us.

Thank you. Many thanks.
