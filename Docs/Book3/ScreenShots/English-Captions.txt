Captions / Notes for the Attached Screenshots (English)

Caption 1:
A numbered, percentage-based progress report was requested against the AGM-approved agenda, because the committee is not a law-making body — it is an executing body.

Caption 2:
Clarification: personal opinions or donations should not be presented as “MC performance.” The only valid benchmark is the AGM-approved agenda — with delays, reasons, and revised timelines stated clearly.

Caption 3:
English summary of the same position, so the message remains equally understandable for every reader.

Caption 4:
Past example: major donations and construction work happened before as well, yet they were not reported as MC “performance.” The benchmark should remain the same today.

Caption 5:
Multiple members agreed in the group: “Only AGM-approved projects are acceptable,” while the sarcastic “pass or tolerate” mindset also surfaced.

Caption 6:
Court news headline and context: public discussion begins around how silence and lack of immediate response are treated in legal reasoning.

Caption 7:
From the report’s framing: silence at the time of wrongdoing, lack of immediate resistance/alarm, and delayed action can be interpreted as a form of voluntary participation/consent — i.e., silence being treated as equivalent to willingly going along with the act.
